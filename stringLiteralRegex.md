The best answer I've found so far to the "match a string literal with a regular expression" question
http://stackoverflow.com/a/27225768

I wonder if anyone's done any sort of research to find out if string literals are actually 100% representable by finite automata and regular languages in all programming languages that have character and string data?  
Something tells me that Unicode _probably_ isn't regular.
